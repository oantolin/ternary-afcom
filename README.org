Library for computational exploration of the ternary relation on a
group /G/ given by (x,y,z) ∈ AC(/G/) ⇔ [x⁻¹y, x⁻¹z] = 1.

To deal with groups we use the [[https://github.com/stylewarning/cl-permutation][cl-permutation]] library, so all groups
must be given via a permutation representation.

Currently there are functions to explore which ternary relations are
induced by AC(/G/) on subsets of /G/ of a given size /k/. To determine
whether two relation are isomorphic we canonicalize them by taking the
lexicographically minimal representation among its orbit under the
action of the symmetric group. This seems fast enough for small /k/.
